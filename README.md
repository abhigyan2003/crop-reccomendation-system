The project presented here focuses on developing a Crop Recommendation System using machine learning
techniques. This system aims to assist farmers in making informed decisions about the most suitable crops to
cultivate given specific soil and climate parameters.
â€¢ This project utilizes a dataset comprising key agricultural features, including soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus,
Potassium), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, alongside the target variable, which identifies the type of
crop. The system leverages various machine learning algorithms to model the relationship between these features
and the corresponding crops, ultimately providing recommendations tailored to specific environmental inputs
